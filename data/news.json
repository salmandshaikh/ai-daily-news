      "summary": "Researchers have discovered that \"confessions\" - a technique where language models are prompted to admit when they don't know something - can significantly improve their honesty and transparency. This approach helps mitigate the spread of misinformation by encouraging models to say \"I don't know\" instead of providing incorrect answers. By doing so, confessions can increase trust in language models and their ability to provide accurate information."
