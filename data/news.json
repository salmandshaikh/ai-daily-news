      "summary": "Researchers have discovered that \"confessions\" - a technique where language models are prompted to admit when they don't know something - can significantly improve their honesty and accuracy. By encouraging models to say \"I don't know\" when unsure, confessions can help mitigate the spread of misinformation and increase trust in AI-generated content. This innovation has the potential to make language models more reliable and transparent."
